# In-Memory Database Tutorial: Building a Redis Clone with Go

Welcome to this series of articles where we will guide you step by step through the process of building an in-memory database like Redis. The goal is to demystify the low-level details involved in databases, data structures, and algorithms.


## Introduction
In this series, we will explore how to build an in-memory database similar to Redis. By "like Redis," we mean implementing some of its commands and focusing on storing data on disk and reading it back into memory when the server is running.

## Project Overview
We chose Go for its simplicity and efficiency. Many databases, such as BoltDB and DiskV, are written in Go.

### What We Will Do:
- Build a Redis clone that supports strings and hashes.
- Write a parser to understand RESP (Redis Serialization Protocol).
- Use goroutines to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
- Implement data persistence using the Append Only File (AOF) method.

In the end, our project will consist of four main files:
```
.
├── aof.go
├── handler.go
├── main.go
└── resp.go
```

## Key Features
- **In-Memory Storage**: Store data in memory for fast access.
- **RESP Parser**: Handle Redis commands and responses.
- **Concurrent Connections**: Use goroutines to manage multiple clients.
- **Data Persistence**: Use the AOF method to write data to disk and recover it after a crash.

## Technical Overview
1. **Core Components**:
   - **Main Server**: Handles incoming client connections.
   - **RESP Parser**: Interprets and processes Redis commands.
   - **Handler**: Manages command execution and data manipulation.
   - **AOF Writer**: Handles writing commands to disk for persistence.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - Utilize goroutines to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Implement the AOF method to ensure data is saved to disk and can be recovered after a restart.

## Build and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16+ installed on your system.

### Build the Server
```bash
go build -o redis-clone main.go aof.go handler.go resp.go
```

### Run the Server
```bash
./redis-clone
```

## Configuration
### Default Configuration
The server uses default configurations which can be modified in the source code.
